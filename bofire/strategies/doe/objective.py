class DOptimality:
    """A class implementing the evaluation of logdet(X.T@X + delta) and its jacobian w.r.t. the inputs.
    The Jacobian can be divided into two parts, one for logdet(X.T@ + delta) w.r.t. X (there is a simple
    closed expression for this one) and one model dependent part for the jacobian of X.T@X
    w.r.t. the inputs. Because each row of X only depends on the inputs of one experiment
    the second part can be formulated in a simplified way. It is built up with n_experiment
    blocks of the same structure which is represended by the attribute jacobian_building_block.

    A nice derivation for the "first part" of the jacobian can be found [here](https://angms.science/doc/LA/logdet.pdf).
    The second part consists of the partial derivatives of the model terms with
    respect to the inputs. We denote the value of the i-th model term from the j-th experiment
    with y_ij and the i-th input value of the j-th experiment with x_ij. N stands for the number
    of model terms, n for the number of input terms and M for the number of experiments.
    Here, we only consider models up to second order, but the computation can easily be extended
    for higher-ordermodels.

    To do the computation in the most basic way, we could compute the partial derivative of every
    single model term and experiment with respect to every single input and experiment. We could write
    this in one large matrix and multiply the first part of the gradient as a long vector from the right
    side.
    But because of the structure of the domain we can do the same computation with much smaller
    matrices:
    First, we write the first part of the jacobian as the matrix (df/dy_ij)_ij where i goes from 1 to N
    and j goes from 1 to M.

    Second, we compute a rank 3 tensor (K_kij)_kij. k goes from 1 to M, i from 1 to n and j from 1 to N.
    For each k (K_kij)_ij contains the partial derivatives (dy_jk/dx_ik)_ij. Note that the values of the
    entries of (dy_jk/dx_ik)_ij only depend on the input values of the k-th experiment. The function
    default_jacobian_building_block implements the computation of these matrices/"building blocks".

    Then, we notice that the model term values of the j-th experiment only depend on the input values of
    the j-th experiment. Thus, to compute the partial derivative df/dx_ik we only have to compute the euclidian
    scalar product of (K_kij)_j and (df/dy_jk)_j. The way how we built the two parts of the jacobian allows us
    to compute this scalar product in a vectorized way for all x_ik at once, see also JacobianForLogDet.jacobian.
