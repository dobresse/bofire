### Getting Started

`GettingStarted.ipynb` contains the python code of the getting started section of the  [GH pages getting started](https://experimental-design.github.io/bofire/start)

### Basic Examples

Additionally, the basic functionality such as setting up the reaction domain, defining objectives and running a bayesian optimization loop is shown in a variety of noteboooks by example.
